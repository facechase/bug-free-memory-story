Welcome to my story. The character is a man called Carry, and the setting
is a city called Setty.
One day, Carry was walking alone in a narrow alley. A man wearing a black windbreaker and a black hat stood on his way. 
The man had a knife attached to his belt, and seemed to have malicious intentions. Carry decided it was best if he just walked away.
Although, initially he seemed get away without being noticed, a shadow started to creep around the corner.
This shadow just kept following him till home. Once he got home, he noticed that the shadow just vanished.
