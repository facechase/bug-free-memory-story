Welcome to my story. The character is a man called Carry, and the setting
is a city called Setty.
One day, Carry was walking alone in a narrow alley. A man wearing a black windbreaker and a black hat stood on his way. 
The man had a knife attached to his belt, and seemed to have malicious intentions. Carry decided it was best if he just walked away.
Although, initially he seemed get away without being noticed, a shadow started to creep around the corner.
This shadow just kept following him till home. Once he got home, he noticed that the shadow just vanished.

Carry began to make dinner. However, as he was finishing up washing all the vegetables and defrosting the meat, he reached for the knife block only to find that the butcher knife had gone missing.
Carry was spooked. He could see the shadow creeping around just outside of his vision, getting closer but vanishing very time he tried to focus on it. His eyes became tunnels, darkness encroaching on the edges and pushing relentlessly in, despite his futile attempts to beat it back with the rapid movement of his eyes. Eventually, the shadow overcame him, dark replacing light in his existence. He awoke some time later, feeling rested. "Yikes", he said, "I'm never injecting marijuana again".
